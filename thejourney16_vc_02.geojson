The landscape architects propose a 'topographical carpet', spreading outwards from building edges, blurring the interface between public and private, active and passive, building and landscape. ",

The site is adjacent to the 'Jawbone' marine reserve in Williamstown, and the design for each part of the school responds to the section of the dune system or coastal woodlands to which it belongs. This approach is evident in the plantings and landscaping treatments throughout the campus and the careful consideration of the flow of water. The students carry out their daily school life in a respectful indigenous landscape. The school incorporates a fresh water ecology program into the curriculum, and a nature trail educates visitors of the landscape's importance. In other parts of the campus are productive gardens and a nursery. The project is a model for an 'environmental education in school landscapes'.",

This project completed under the Revitalising Central Dandenong urban renewal initiative offers a public square that is truly civic in nature, providing for gatherings, events, diversity, arts and culture. The space could have easily been dominated by the neo brutalist architecture of the Lyons-designed Dandenong Civic Centre and Library adjacent, however the fine grain of its paving design and splashes of intense colour give the square a strong presence that is at once warm and welcoming. The paving motif, done in collaboration with Material Thinking, was created from fabric patterns found around Dandenong and enriches the design with cultural narrative and meaning. In the centre of the square a grid of mature araucarias provide definition and intimacy, and a large public screen ensures a constant sense of activity. The project also provides the missing link in the pedestrian spine connecting Lonsdale Street and Dandenong Station via Halpin Way and Settlers Square. ",

At the same time the exhibit had to approximate a specific natural habitat and provide a compelling visitor experience.\nThe exhibit reflects a new approach in zoological design, one that merges design, engineering and constructed ecology. The water in the three Hippo ponds is filtered through the wetland system to remove suspended solids, trap and remove organisms and decrease overall nutrient levels. The system's total capacity is approximately 4.5 million litres.\n",

The challenge was to take visitors on a journey of before, during and after the fire, without them reliving the horror of the event. The memorial sits in a peaceful and tucked away section of public reserve near the recreation reserve which was the central gathering point for the community immediately after the fires. It was designed to fit within the bushland setting with seating for quiet contemplation and reflection. ",

The site is adjacent to the 'Jawbone' marine reserve in Williamstown, and the design for each part of the school responds to the section of the dune system or coastal woodlands to which it belongs. This approach is evident in the plantings and landscaping treatments throughout the campus and the careful consideration of the flow of water. The students carry out their daily school life in a respectful indigenous landscape. The school incorporates a fresh water ecology program into the curriculum, and a nature trail educates visitors of the landscape's importance. In other parts of the campus are productive gardens and a nursery. The project is a model for an 'environmental education in school landscapes'.",

This project completed under the Revitalising Central Dandenong urban renewal initiative offers a public square that is truly civic in nature, providing for gatherings, events, diversity, arts and culture. The space could have easily been dominated by the neo brutalist architecture of the Lyons-designed Dandenong Civic Centre and Library adjacent, however the fine grain of its paving design and splashes of intense colour give the square a strong presence that is at once warm and welcoming. The paving motif, done in collaboration with Material Thinking, was created from fabric patterns found around Dandenong and enriches the design with cultural narrative and meaning. In the centre of the square a grid of mature araucarias provide definition and intimacy, and a large public screen ensures a constant sense of activity. The project also provides the missing link in the pedestrian spine connecting Lonsdale Street and Dandenong Station via Halpin Way and Settlers Square. ",

At the same time the exhibit had to approximate a specific natural habitat and provide a compelling visitor experience.\nThe exhibit reflects a new approach in zoological design, one that merges design, engineering and constructed ecology. The water in the three Hippo ponds is filtered through the wetland system to remove suspended solids, trap and remove organisms and decrease overall nutrient levels. The system's total capacity is approximately 4.5 million litres.\n",

The challenge was to take visitors on a journey of before, during and after the fire, without them reliving the horror of the event. The memorial sits in a peaceful and tucked away section of public reserve near the recreation reserve which was the central gathering point for the community immediately after the fires.
